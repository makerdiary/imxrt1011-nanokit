# iMX RT1011 Nano Kit<br/><small>Rapid prototyping with high-performance processing designed around NXP's iMX RT1011 Crossover MCU</small>

## Introduction

iMX RT1011 Nano Kit is a small, high-performing prototyping kit designed around NXP's iMX RT1011 Crossover MCU based on the Arm Cortex-M7 core, which operates at speeds up to 500 MHz to provide high CPU performance and best real-time response. It has 128 KB on-chip RAM that can be flexibly configured as TCM or general-purpose as well as numerous peripherals including high speed USB, UART, SPI, I2C, SAI, PWM, GPIO, ADC and etc to support a wide range of applications.

The design provides external 128 Mbit QSPI flash with XIP support, flexible power management, programmable LED and Button, easy-to-use form factor with USB-C and dual-row 40 pins in DIP/SMT type, including up to 33 multi-function GPIO pins (15 can be configured as ADC inputs) and Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port. Available with loose or pre-soldered headers, for even more flexibility in your projects.

It's shipped with UF2 Bootloader for easy firmware update. Zephyr RTOS and Python are supported as well for rapid prototyping.
