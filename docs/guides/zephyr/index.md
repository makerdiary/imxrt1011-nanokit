# Develop with Zephyr RTOS

## Introduction

The Zephyr Project is a Linux Foundation hosted Collaboration Project. It’s an open-source collaborative effort uniting developers and users in building a best-in-class small, scalable real⁃time operating system (RTOS) optimized for resource-constrained devices, across multiple architectures.

## Key Features

* Open-source real time operating system, with vibrant community participation
* Comprehensive, lightweight, kernel & supporting services, inherently portable & secure
* Complete, fully integrated, highly configurable, modular for flexibility
* Fully connected with Bluetooth 5.0 & BLE, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, CANbus, IoT protocols like CoAP, LwM2M, MQTT, OpenThread and USB & USB-C
* Developer-friendly, logging, tracing, debugging, built-in shell, Windows/Linux/macOS support
* Product development ready using LTS that includes security updates
* Permissively licensed - Apache 2.0 with vendor neutral governance, broad SoC, board and sensor support
