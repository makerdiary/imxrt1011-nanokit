# Code in Python

## Introduction

Python is a high-level programming language which means it's designed to be easier to read, write and maintain. It has a built-in interpreter which means there are no extra steps, like compiling, to get your code to work.

iMX RT1011 Nano Kit can run [CircuitPython] which allows you to access hardware-specific functionality and peripherals in the popular Python programming language. With CircuitPython, there are no upfront desktop downloads needed. Once you get your board set up, open any text editor, and start editing code. It's that simple.

!!! question "Why CircuitPython?"
    CircuitPython is based on [MicroPython] and features unified Python core APIs and a growing list of 300+ device libraries and drivers that work with it. See [differences from MicroPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython#differences-from-micropython).
