# iMX RT1011 Nano Kit Programming Guide

iMX RT1011 Nano Kit is shipped with the UF2 Bootloader, which is an easy-to-use and self-upgradable bootloader that can be used to update the firmware by just copying the `.uf2`-format images to the flash drive.

In addition, you can always enter the ROM Serial Downloader even when the UF2 Bootloader gets corrupted somehow and use the [MCUXpresso Secure Provisioning Tool] to build and write the images to the board.
